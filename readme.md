### About

üêí Why `unmonoqueteclea`? It means **typing monkey** (in Spanish).
And [this Wikipedia
entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) will
help you understand it. Although you will find me everywhere as
`unmonoqueteclea`, my name is **Pablo Gonz√°lez Carrizo**.

Most of my knowledge comes from other people that made her thoughts
and code public (some of my favorites are [RMS](https://stallman.org),
[PG](http://www.paulgraham.com/) or
[Prot](https://protesilaos.com/)). I am morally obliged to do my bit.

I consider myself an **end-to-end engineer**, the kind of person that can
transform ideas into working prototypes in a few nights fueled with
some cups of tea.

In my free time, I maintain some little side [projects](https://unmonoqueteclea.github.io/projects.html) 
such us [voilib](https://voilib.com) or [valencia-now](https://valencianow.streamlit.app/).
