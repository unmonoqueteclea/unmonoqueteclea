### About

üêí Why `unmonoqueteclea`? It means **typing monkey** (in Spanish).
And [this Wikipedia
entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) will
help you understand it. Although you will find me everywhere as
`unmonoqueteclea`, my name is **Pablo Gonz√°lez Carrizo**.

Most of my knowledge comes from other people that made her thoughts
and code public (some of my favorites are [RMS](https://stallman.org),
[PG](http://www.paulgraham.com/),
[SachaChua](https://sachachua.com/blog/) or
[Prot](https://protesilaos.com/)). I am morally obliged to do my bit.

I consider myself an end-to-end engineer, the kind of engineer that
can transform product ideas into prototypes in a few nights with some
cups of tea üçµ. Software is eating the world and Machine Learning is
eating software. I've spent some years dealing with the development of
Machine Learning-based products and I learned to design creative
solutions for complex problems in this new paradigm.

In my free time, I maintain my little side project: üéß
[Voilib](https://voilib.com), an AI-based search engine for
podcasts. If you are a podcast addict like me, you will like it!
