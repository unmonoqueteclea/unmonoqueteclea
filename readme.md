### About

üêí Why `unmonoqueteclea`? It means **typing monkey** (in Spanish).
And [this Wikipedia
entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) will
help you understand it. Although you will find me everywhere as
`unmonoqueteclea`, my name is **Pablo Gonz√°lez Carrizo**.

Most of my knowledge comes from other people that made her thoughts
and code public (some of my favorites are [RMS](https://stallman.org),
[PG](http://www.paulgraham.com/),
[SachaChua](https://sachachua.com/blog/) or
[Prot](https://protesilaos.com/)]). I am morally obliged to do my bit.
